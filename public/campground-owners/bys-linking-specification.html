			<h3>How To Link To BookYourSite.com</h3>
			<p>Hello Campground!  The BookYourSite.com system requires that you tie our website into your own.  We're going to show you a few examples of how to integrate our software to <strong>call your website visitors to action</strong> -- <i>making new reservations at your park!</i></p>
			<p>First thing's first... the link itself.  Attached to the email that was sent to you when your campground became active on bookyoursite.com is a link that looks like:</p>
			<p>https://secure.bookyoursite.com/go/yourpark</p>
			<p>Our intent in putting this link on your website is to get the user to actually USE it.  Following are a few ways of getting the user to link.</p>
			<p><strong>IMPORTANT FACT: 90% OF WEBSITE CLICKS HAPPEN IN THE TOP HALF OF THE WEB PAGE</strong><br/>
			That's right, web page viewers are picky!  They won't search for links on your site -- if they can't find what they want, they'll go to your competitors website who did it better.  If you want them to click a link, put it in front of them in a clear and noticible position.  You're looking to sell your camp sites, so put the 'call to action' right in front of them!</p>
			<h3>Example 1: Custom Navigation Element</h3>
			<p><img src="/img/jellystone-custom-bys-butto.gif"></p>
			<p>This website has built a link to BookYourSite.com into their primary navigation.  A user clicking Reservations will get the campground's custom BookYourSite.com landing page, where they can make a complete online reservation.  If for any reason the customer wishes to call the park, all they must do is click "Contact the Park" and your phone number and email address is displayed.  This method of linking has been extremely effective and is highly recommended.</p>
			<h3>Example 2: BookYourSite.com Logo Links</h3>
			<p align="center"><i>Reserve Your Site Online Free</i><br/><img src="/img/bys_logo.gif"></p>
			<p>Our logo says it all!  A prominently placed BookYourSite.com logo will guide your visitors to action, particularly when directed with some nearby text.</p>
			<p><i>HTML Programming Code (change the sample link to your own specific park link)</i><br>
			<textarea readonly rows="3" cols="65" onclick="this.focus();this.select()" id="code"><a href="https://secure.bookyoursite.com/go/campsample" target="_blank"><i>Reserve Your Site Online Free</i><br/><img src="http://www.bookyoursite.com/img/bys_logo.gif" alt="Book Your Camping Reservation Online"></a></textarea></p>
