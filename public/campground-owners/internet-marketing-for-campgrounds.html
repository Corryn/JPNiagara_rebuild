			<h3>Introduction To Internet Marketing For Campgrounds</h3>
			<p>You spent money with a web designer to design a website for your campground.  Is it performing for you?  In the case of most campground websites, the answer would be an emphatic <i>no</i>.</p>
			<p><strong>So what's wrong?</strong>  Well, this isn't field of dreams, and if you build it, they will come does not apply to a website.  In fact, your website is one of billions on the Internet and happens to only be interesting for a small fraction of the population (those looking to camp/rv in your area).  So what's the solution?  There is no one answer, but there are a few suggestions that will each definately help.  They are as follows:</p>
			<p><strong>Put Up A Good Website</strong></p>
			<p>This isn't the place to pinch pennies.  Your website is how new customers will look for you in todays (and tomorrows) world.  It's also your best salesperson as it can tell a story and show images to illustrate why someone should come to camp/rv with you.  Give the customer all the information they want so that they can plan their vacation with you at all hours of the day.</p>
			<p><strong>Use Your Existing Print Advertising To Advertise Your Website</strong></p>
			<p>Your website can say more through text, photos and videos than print advertising ever can.  Put your URL (www.yourcampground.com) on everything you do - business cards, letterhead, emails, brochures and other print advertising.  Heck, put it on your phone system message - 'visit us online at www.yourcampground.com!'.  Make them look at your best ad first -- your website.</p>
			<p><strong>Put Up Roadsigns</strong></p>
			<p>You want new customers to find you - not just your existing ones who get your brochure.  In a crowded Internet, people go to the websites who sort through the 'net to find what's most relevant.  That's where the search engines come in.  Whether it's Google, Yahoo, MSN or one of the hundreds of others, people don't just magically type in your website address - the search engine points them to you.  And, fortunately, even if Google isn't cooperating with your website - you can pay a fee to have the website surfer find you!</p>
			<p>If that sounds expensive, don't worry it's not.  At our own campground, we send out brochures to our former clients every year.  That costs us somewhere around $0.60 per brochure including postage.  On the Intenet, we pay 10 cents or less per click to have a highly qualified web surfer find us!  That's a HUGE bargain for our business.  Even at 5 times the cost, we're still saving money in our advertising on a per-viewer basis - plus it's our best brochure doing the talking for us, our website.  We suggest you check out <script type="text/javascript"><!--
