				<h3>Online Reservations Have Never Been So Easy</h3>
			<p>At this point, there is no question, the Internet is here to stay.  Your customers demand the ability to browse and book campsites and RV sites online any hour of the day just like they do hotels and airline tickets.</p>
			<p>At Mission Management, the makers of <a href="http://www.campgroundmanager.com">Campground Manager Software</a>, we recognized that need.  Hey, we needed it ourselves since we're still the only campground software business (that we know of) who actually owns a campground too.  We built BookYourSite.com for ourselves, and we built it for our existing <a href="http://www.campgroundmanager.com">Campground Manager</a> customers, and we built it for all the other campgrounds too -- you don't need to be using our campground management software to use BookYourSite.com.</p>
			<p>So, you're interested in finding out a bit more about BookYourSite.com?  Why not give it a test drive and give us a call.  Just <a href="https://secure.bookyoursite.com/go/progressive" target="_blank">click here</a> to make a reservation at our virtual campground <a href="https://secure.bookyoursite.com/go/progressive" target="_blank">Progressive Campground</a> and use our fake Visa number (4111 1111 1111 1111) and an expiry date anytime after today to give it a whirl.</p>
			<p><B>What's the bottom line?</B>
			<ul>
			<li>We're putting you in control of your business online without the restrictions that some other companies force on you.</li>
			<li>We're empowering businesses by generating new customers for you just for taking reservations with us -- all for the same fixed rate.</li>
			<li>We're not skimming percentages of your transactions or getting between you and your money, just one low fixed rate per reservation as you get them.</li>
			</ul>		
To learn more about BookYourSite.com - including how to sign up - you'll have to give us a call. <b>1-800-547-9147</b>.
