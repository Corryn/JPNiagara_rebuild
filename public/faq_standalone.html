</div>

<p><strong>What is BookYourSite.com (BYS)?</strong><br/>
BookYourSite is an online booking portal that allows your customer to make campsite/cabin/trailer reservations online any time of the day or night. 
BYS is fully integrated with Campground Manager Software&reg; or can be used as a standalone online service. </p> 

<p><strong>What is the cost?</strong><br/>
There is an annual connection fee of $195 per year which includes telephone support and a one time $99 setup fee.  You will be invoiced a flat fee 
of $5 per online transaction (billed monthly).  You may cancel at any time on 30 days notice.  </p>

<p><strong>How do I provide BYS with occupancy and rate information for my park?</strong><br/>
You provide us with your online rates using an input form.  Our staff will set up your rates, taxes and discounts for the season.  You&#39;ll also 
provide us with the number of sites you wish to make available online.</p>  

<p><strong>How do I receive funds from a reservation booked on BYS?</strong><br/>
When a reservation is received on BYS, the transaction information is moved to your park file.  You access this file by logging into a web application 
to securely retrieve the information.  All the reservation details can then be entered into your reservation system.  The credit card information is 
passed to you for processing, on your system ensuring you get paid immediately.  You also have the option to set up a PayPal account and process the 
payment during the reservation process.   An email confirmation can be sent directly from the web application while retrieving the reservation details. </p> 

<p><strong>How long will it take to get online with BYS?</strong><br/>
Once our staff receives your rates and site details it takes 7 or 10 business days to get your system configured to accept bookings.  A website will 
also be created for your park to be used on the BYS portal and iPhone mobile app. </p> 

<p><strong>Do I need any additional hardware or software?</strong><br/>
You will need a high-speed internet connection and a computer. No additional hardware or software is required.

<p><strong>How will customers find my park using BYS?</strong><br/>
We will place a link on you website for customer to book online.  The link will direct them to your online booking portal on BYS.  We also have an 
online directory that will contain a webpage with your park information and pictures.  Customer will also see your park details on our new iPhone or iPad app. </p> 

<p><strong>Do I have to put all my sites online?</strong><br/>
No, you can choose which site types or accommodations to put online and the quantities of each site type to offer.  You may reduce the number of sites 
available for any date range at any time. </p> 

<p><strong>What if a BYS customer wants to cancel their reservation?</strong><br/>
Since the reservation and payment have been created on your system then the customer will call you directly to cancel.  Your cancellation policy will be 
in force.  You must pay the original $5 BYS booking fee even if the customer cancels so keep this in mind when setting a cancellation fee.  </p>
