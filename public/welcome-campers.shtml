<h1>Welcome Campers!<h1>
<br>
	     <p>Please accept our invitation to visit our family oriented campground located just minutes from the brink of mighty Niagara Falls!</p>
	     <p>As of the spring of 2004, Jellystone Niagara has changed ownership and is now operated by the Amadio family.  With 39 years experience in the campground and RV business the Amadios and their staff have been upgrading Jellystone Park each season.</p>
	     <p>Last spring phase 2 of the RV section upgrade was complete.  We entirely removed the old outdated sites, changing the lot layout, making them larger (up to 80 ft in length) and converting them to pull throughs. The electricity was changed on these sites to accommodate both the 30 and 50 amp power requirements. Water and sewer lines were also replaced and roads were widened and re-graded. These changes will improve our ability to handle big rigs and large RV groups and rallies. The size of our rental program was also increased, replacing old units with 10 brand new rental trailers.</p>
                   <p>This season we will be spending time upgrading our washroom facilities.  New showers and toilets are planed for both the main and recreation hall restrooms.</p>	     
 	     <p>The parks recreation program has been greatly expanded to include more dances, daily activities and fun, exciting themes the whole family will enjoy. We will continue to run our direct shuttle bus to the Falls which links up with the Niagara Falls and <a href="niagara-falls-tour.shtml">Great Gorge Adventure Pass</a>. This excursion includes the <a href="niagara-falls-tour.shtml">Journey Behind The Falls</a>, the <a href="niagara-falls-tour.shtml">Maid Of The Mist</a> as well as two additional attractions and all day transportation. </p>
	     <p>We are also close to Marineland, Safari Niagara – ZooZ, numerous golf courses, nature trails, shopping, outlet malls, and much more.</p>
	     <p>We look forward to having you as our guest. Our staff is at your service to make your stay with us a memorable and fun-filled vacation.</p>
	     <p>Regards,</p>
	     <p><strong>Ranger Smith &amp; Yogi Bear</strong></p>
