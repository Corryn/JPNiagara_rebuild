Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park™ at Indian River is a wooded campground located in the heart of Northern Michigan that offers peace and quiet away from the hectic pace of life. 

We have sites for RVs with full service, as well as sites with electric and water or electric only. Primitive tenting areas are also available. If you're not bringing your own equipment, we invite you to try one of our cozy cottages, or pop-up rentals. Feel safe leaving your RV on our grounds, as RV storage is just one of the many services that we provide. A sanitary dump station, propane, hot shower and spotless restrooms, laundromat and goodie shop are all on-site for campers to use.

The facilities at our park will provide you with hours of fun and entertainment! We have a unique, Michigan-shaped heated pool, plus a fun-filled game room with pool tables. You and your family can putt your way around our 18 hold mini-golf course, and the kids will have plenty of playtime fun at our playground. An outdoor theatre is available for you to enjoy cartoons, and you can stay active with volleyball, shuffleboard, bocce ball, horseshoes and tetherball. Yogi Bear™ is waiting to meet you! Come see where Yogi spends his quiet time.
